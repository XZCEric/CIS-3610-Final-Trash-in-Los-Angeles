                            On the streets of Los Angeles all kinds of trash like paper, furniture, food waste is being
                            thrown on the curbside, on the road and it is everywhere. This is not only affecting the
                            cleanness of the street but also affecting the living conditions of people living in the
                            area. People are more likely to be exposed to toxic chemicals that came from any electronic
                            waste or horrible smells from food waste. <em>Now about 5,200 tons of solid waste are being
                                produced everyday in L.A.</em> most of them go to landfills waiting to be decomposed,
                            but there
                            is an uncalculated amount of trash that will stay on the curbside, middle of street waiting
                            to be picked up, or sitting there forever.

                    <p>
                        Illegal dumping is discarding any waste, whether it is oil, furniture, appliances, trash,
                        litter or landscaping cuttings, etc., upon any public right-of-way, City property or private
                        property, without consent of the owner. Amount of illegal dumping in the city of L.A. has jumped
                        <b>450% from 2016 to 2020.</b> The ever increasing amount of trash on the streets and alleyways,
                        making
                        it unsafe for pedestrians, cyclists, drivers and all residents in impacted neighborhoods.
                        Although if you get caught for illegal dumping you may <b>pay a fine up to $10,000 and can end
                            up
                            to six months in jail,</b> but there is no one who watches over the street and catch who is
                        dumping
                        this trash onto the street.

                    <p>
                        There are <b>over 750,000 families</b> who live in the city of Los Angeles, and a <b>recorded
                            6,500
                            tons of trash</b> is being collected daily by L.A. sanitation (not counting the ones dumped
                        on the
                        street). Trash gets collected on a scheduled collection day and gets picked up weekly. In
                        L.A. we use these trash bins that can <b>hold up to 50 pounds of trash.</b> Sometimes those
                        trash cans
                        get filled up quickly, and people would have nowhere to put their trash, and it will be just
                        left on the ground, causing it to stack up more and more over time and can cause blocking of way
                        and horrible smells.

                    <p>
                        Although L.A. sanitation does a very hard job to try to keep the city of L.A. clean, sometimes
                        they can run into trouble trying to pick up trash. For example, like large pieces of furniture
                        being disposed of on the street, their trash cars are not meant to pick up things like that.
                        There could also be harmful electronic waste that needs to be handled carefully, and sometimes
                        there is food waste scattered on the street side making it impossible to pick up. The most
                        important thing is that while issues like this keep happening <b>there is no one to come and
                            clean and pick them up.</b> So the condition just keeps getting worse and worse until
                        someone
                        decides that it is too much and they want to clean it up.

                                <li>This can be done easier than you think, there are 6500 Tons of trash produced
                                    every day, and almost a quarter of that is food waste. Just imagine how much food is
                                    being wasted there. What we can do instead is buy what you can eat, don’t buy an
                                    excessive amount and put it in the freezer, wait for it to go bad, and then throw it
                                    away.</li>

                                <li>Bring your own fabric bag to the store and use less plastic bags, plus the fabric
                                    bag usually costs less than a dollar, and sometimes there are people passing them
                                    out for free. </li>

                                    right? This way there will be less harmful electronic waste produced.

                                    Southern California Edison, etc offer paperless bills, this will reduce the amount
                                    of paper wasted.

                                <li>Recycling is the process of converting waste materials into new materials and
                                    objects. There is a lot of stuff you can actually recycle, first let’s begin with a
                                    simple one that is a plastic bottle, utensils and containers, although it is best to
                                    try not using them, but it’s hard since a lot of drinks, food come with it. There
                                    are a lot of bottle recycling centers like rePlanet, ponce recycling center, etc.,
                                    you can find one around your neighborhood. (All links of recycling center will be

                        When you switch that old sofa to a new soft comfy one, what do you do with the old one? The
                        wrong thing to do is just putting it on the streetside and blocking the roadway. The easiest
                        thing to do is drop it off at your local bulky item drop-off spot, or if you don’t have a large
                        enough car you can call them at 1-800-773-2489 (only for LA county area) or use the MyLA311 app
                        (only for LA county area) to schedule a curbside pick-up. Something else you can do is to donate
                        it
                        to charity or a non-profit organization, if the furniture is going to waste why don’t you use it
                        to help other people out instead. (Things like sofa, fridge & freezer, carpet all fit into this
                        category)

                        need
                        to be disposed properly, or it can release toxic chemicals into the air and can cause
                        symptoms like headache or vomiting. Please don’t dump these on the ground because there is
                        liquid
                        waste like paint and mercury that is very hard to clean, and this liquid waste needs to be
                        separated from the rest. LA Sanitation (LASAN) has established programs for Los Angeles City and
                        L.A. County residents to safely dispose their household hazardous waste. This waste can be
                        dropped off at permanent collection sites known as S.A.F.E. Centers or mobile collection events
                        located throughout the City of Los Angeles.

                        Sharps/needles should not be thrown into the trash cans, because it can cause cross
                        contamination. After the use of a sharp immediately place used needles and other sharps in a
                        sharps
                        disposal container to reduce the risk of needle sticks, cuts or punctures from loose sharps. DO
                        use an FDA-cleared sharps disposal container, if possible. Then you may be able to drop off your
                        sharps disposal containers at nearby collections sites, such as doctors' offices, hospitals,
                        pharmacies, health departments, medical waste facilities and a police or fire stations. If you
                        can go to the doctor’s office or hospital where you got the sharps from in the first place.
